## Contributing Guidelines

All pull requests are welcome in this package whether it be new code or unit tests.

Code should ideally be PSR-2, if any code is not PSR-2 compliant then we also welcome pull requests to correct those classes.  PHP Namespacing is essential. 

The aim of this package is to make the best use of inheritence to replicate the schema.org structure in PHP Classes that provide an easy interface for users to create schema.org markup.

Our initial aim is to have each class providing output in json-ld as and when needed.
